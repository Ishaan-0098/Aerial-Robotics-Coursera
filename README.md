# Robotics: Aerial Robotics
This repository contains notes and assignments for the first course in Robotics Specialization offered by University of Pennsylvania on Coursera. 

## Assignments completed using Quadrotor simulator

1. Implemented a PD controller to control the height of a quadrotor (*Hover maneuver*).
1. Implemented a PD controller to make the quadrotor follow a desired 2D trajectory (*straight line & sine curve*).
1. Implemented a PD controller to make the quadrotor follow a desired 3D trajectory (*given a set of waypoints*).

## Topics covered

1. Quadrotor Kinematics and Dynamics
1. Motion Planning and Control for Quadrotors
1. Introduction to Nonlinear Control
